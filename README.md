> In these pandemic days kid's find is very difficult to do fun stuff, in this project I have tried to built a task for kids that they can do at home and also learn new things. It is designed keeping in mind the STEM learning concept.

# Project Description
>The following design is made under the idea of STEM learning for kids. Here we use a ESP8266 NodeMcu Microcontroller to create a Wi-Fi access point. Then using app inventor Kodular we develop an application to connect to ESP8266 and control the led, turning them ON and OFF wirelessly.
